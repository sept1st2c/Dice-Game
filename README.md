# Dice-Game
Here again, with my 2nd React Project. 

How to play dice game ?
1-Click on dice image
-after click on dice if selected number is equal to dice number you
will get same point as dice
-if you get wrong guess then 1 point will be dedcuted

Consists of HomePage ("StartGame.jsx")
Which takes us to GamePage ("GamePlay.jsx")
which includes the game interface ("NumberSelector.jsx", "RoleDice.jsx", "Total Score.jsx", etc "

was a Fun project to make




(React was very much complex for me in the start but im slowly getting a bit familiar with it
Learned a lot of java script with this one, some splash screen and basic of animations. 
will post my other project soon)
